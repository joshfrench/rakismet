Rakismet
========

Akismet [http://akismet.com/] is a collaborative spam filtering service.
Rakismet is easy Akismet integration with your Rails app.


Setup
=====

Install with script/plugin install git://github.com/jfrench/rakismet

To get up and running with Rakismet, you'll need an API key from the folks at
WordPress. Head on over to http://wordpress.com/api-keys/ and sign up for a
new username.

Rakismet installation should have created a file called rakismet.rb in
config/initializers. Add your WordPress key and the front page or home URL of
your app. Rakismet::URL must be a fully qualified URI including the http://.

If that file is missing, create it and add the following:

  Rakismet::KEY = 'your key from WordPress'
  Rakismet::URL = 'http://base url for your application/'

Now introduce Rakismet to your application. Let's assume you have a Comment
model and a CommentsController:

  class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_rakismet
  end

  class CommentController < ActionController::Base
    has_rakismet
  end

Rakismet sends the following information to the spam-hungry robots at Akismet,
which means you should be capturing and storing these in your Comment model:

  author        : name submitted with the comment
  author_url    : URL submitted with the comment
  author_email  : email submitted with the comment
  comment_type  : 'comment', 'trackback', 'pingback', or whatever you fancy
  content       : the content submitted
	
There are a few optional fields. It's a good idea to store these, but you
don't have to. If you omit them, they will be found in the request and sent
with the spam? but not spam! or ham! methods.

  user_ip       : IP address used to submit this comment
  user_agent    : user agent string
  referrer      : http referer

If your attributes don't match these names, pass has_rakismet a hash mapping
the default attributes to your own:

  class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_rakismet :author => :commenter_name,
                 :author_email => :commenter_email
  end

If you need more complicated behavior, you can map attributes to procs.
Inside these blocks, +self+ will be evaluated as the current model
instance. This means you can do the following:

  class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :author

    has_rakismet :author => proc { author.name },
                 :author_email => proc { author.email }
  end

Usage
=====

Rakismet provides three methods for interacting with Akismet:

  spam?

From within a CommentsController action, simply call @comment.spam? to get a
true/false response. True means it's spam, false means it's not. Well,
usually; it's possible something went wrong and Akismet returned an error
message. @comment.spam? will return false if this happens. You can check
@comment.akismet_response to be certain; anything other than 'true' or 'false'
means you got an error. That said, as long as you're collecting the data
listed above it's probably sufficient to check spam? alone.

  ham! and spam!

Akismet works best with your feedback. If you spot a comment that was
erroneously marked as spam, @comment.ham! will resubmit to Akismet, marked as
a false positive. Likewise if they missed a spammy comment, @comment.spam!
will resubmit marked as spam.
